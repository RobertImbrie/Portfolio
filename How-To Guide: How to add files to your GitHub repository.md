# Some notes from the author
Hi, my name is Robbie Imbrie! You're probably reading this because I've applied for a job at your company. Since most of the documentation I've worked on is internal, I've created writing samples instead.

This sample assumes the user is familiar with the GitHub UI and workflow, which influences the information I decided to include. For example, I take it as a given that the user can find the repository by themselves.

That said, I still assume the user is fairly new to GitHub. For most software developers, using the command line interface would make you an advanced user. However, for this audience I considered using GitHub Desktop's push and pull UI to be advanced.

Since [How-To Guides should have some flexibility](https://documentation.divio.com/how-to-guides/), I give several solutions.

Thank you for your time. I hope you enjoy the sample below!

# How-To Guide: How to add files to your GitHub repository

## Introduction

This guide helps you add new files to your GitHub repository. Before you start, you'll need just a couple of things: a GitHub account and an existing repository.

There's three ways to add files to your repository:

- Create a new file.
- Upload files from your computer.
- If you're an advanced user, you can also push new files into your repository with GitHub Desktop.

We'll explain the process for each.

## Create a new file

### Step 1. Navigate to your repository

### Step 2. Create the file

1. Click **Add files > Create new file**.
2. Click **Name your file...** and enter a title.
3. Under **Edit new file**, enter your file content.

### Step 3. Optional: Add a comment

GitHub will automatically generate a comment based on the file name. If you'd like to create your own comment instead, you can:

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
2. A text box will say **Create** followed by the file name. Click there and enter a new title.
3. Click **Add an optional extended description...** and enter a description.

### Step 4. Commit the file

Click **Commit new file**.

## Upload files from your computer

### Step 1. Navigate to your repository

### Step 2. Add the files

1. Click **Add files > Upload files**.
2. Drag files into the box.

### Step 3. Optional: Add a comment

GitHub will automatically generate a comment based on the file name. If you'd like to create your own comment instead, you can:

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
2. A text box will say **Create** followed by your comment title. Click there and enter a new title.
3. Click **Add an optional extended description...** and enter a description.

### Step 4. Commit the file

Click **Commit new file**.

## Push new files into your repository from GitHub desktop

The repository must already be [cloned](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) and [updated](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) for this to work.

### Step 1. Navigate to the repository folder on your computer

### Step 2. Drag the new files into your repository folder

### Step 3. Open GitHub Desktop

### Step 4. Select your repository

1. Click **View > Repository list.**
2. Select your repository.

### Step 5. Commit changes

1. Navigate to the lower left hand corner.
2. Click **Summary (Required)** and enter a comment title.
3. Click **Description** and enter a comment description. (Optional)
4. Click **Commit to main.**

### Step 6. Push changes

1. Navigate to the blue **Push commits to the origin remote** box.
2. Click **Push Origin**.
