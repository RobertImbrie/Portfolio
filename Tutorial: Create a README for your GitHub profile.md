# Some notes from the author

Hi, my name is Robbie Imbrie! You're probably reading this because I've applied for a job at your company. Since most of the documentation I've worked on is internal, I've created writing samples instead.

I started this sample by conducting an audience analysis. During my analysis, I determined all four samples would be directed at users who are new to both coding and GitHub. As a result, I've used a friendly, encouraging tone.

I also assumed these samples would be part of GitHub's existing documentation, which influenced which information I decided to include. For example, since GitHub's introductory "Hello World" tutorial has a detailed explanation of repositories, I only included a brief summary in my tutorial.

Finally, I used several sources for my writing samples. For grammar and formatting, I followed the [Microsoft style guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/). For appearance, I used [GitHub's guides](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) as inspiration. For overall structure, I used [Divio's four-part documentation system](https://documentation.divio.com/structure/).

Thank you for your time. I hope you enjoy the sample below!

# Tutorial: Create a README for your GitHub profile

## Introduction

The GitHub profile README is a customizable document that appears on your profile page. You can add text, images, GIFs, or even your Spotify playlist!

In this tutorial, we'll teach you how to make a GitHub profile README. You'll also learn about creating and managing repositories. If that sounds complicated, don't worry: a repository is just a place where you store files, similar to a folder on your computer.

All you need for this tutorial is a GitHub account. Make sure you're logged in!

## Step 1. Go to the GitHub home page

## Step 2. Create your profile repository

Just like you need a folder to store computer files, you need a repository to store your README.

1. Navigate to the **Repositories** tab on the left side.
2. Click **New**.
3. Enter your username under **Repository name**. If your spelling and capitalization are correct, a special message will appear.

4. Select **Add a README file**.
5. Click **Create repository**.

## Step 3. Edit the README

Now that we've made a repository, we need to edit the README document.

1. Click the pencil icon in the upper right hand corner of the README document.
2. Change the text to whatever you'd like.
3. Scroll down and click **Commit changes**.

## Step 4. Visit your profile

Let's take a look at the changes we've made.

1. Click the avatar in the upper right hand corner.
2. Click **Your profile**.

## Congratulations!

You should now see the README text in your profile. You should feel proud! You've learned to:

- Create a repository.
- Modify files.
- Navigate GitHub.
- Make a profile that stands out.

You're well on your way to becoming a GitHub master.
