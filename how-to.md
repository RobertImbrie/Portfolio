The How-To Guide here assumes more understanding of the GitHub UI and workflow. For example, I don't handhold the user on how to find their repository. Likewise, I give solutions to the problem for both the GitHub website and GitHub Desktop, since [How-To Guides should have some flexibility](https://documentation.divio.com/how-to-guides/).

That said, I still assume the user is fairly new to GitHub. For most software developers, using the command line interface would make you an advanced GitHub user. However, I considered push and pull commands to be advanced for this audience.

# Introduction

This guide helps you add new files to your GitHub repository. Before you start, you'll need just a couple of things: a GitHub account and an existing repository.

There's three ways to add files to your repository:

- Create a new file.
- Upload files from your computer.
- If you're an advanced user, you can also push new files into your repository with GitHub Desktop.

We'll explain the process for each.

# Create a new file

## Step 1. Navigate to your repository

## Step 2. Create the file

1. Click **Add files > Create new file**.
2. Click **Name your file...** and enter a title.
3. Under **Edit new file**, enter your file content.

## Step 3. Optional: Add a comment

GitHub will automatically generate a comment based on the file name. Otherwise, you can:

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
2. A text box will say **Create** followed by the file name. Click there and enter a new title.
3. Click **Add an optional extended description...** and enter a description.

## Step 4. Commit the file

Click **Commit new file**.

# Upload files from your computer

## Step 1. Navigate to your repository

## Step 2. Add the files

1. Click **Add files > Upload files**.
2. Drag files into the box.

## Step 3. Optional: Add a comment

GitHub will automatically generate a comment based on the file name. Otherwise, you can:

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page.
2. A text box will say **Create** followed by your comment title. Click there and enter a new title.
3. Click **Add an optional extended description...** and enter a description.

## Step 4. Commit the file

Click **Commit new file**.

# Push new files into your repository from GitHub desktop

The repository must already be [cloned](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) and [updated](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop) for this to work.

## Step 1. Navigate to the repository folder on your computer

## Step 2. Drag the new files into your repository folder

## Step 3. Open GitHub Desktop

## Step 4. Select your repository

1. Click **View > Repository list.**
2. Select your repository.

## Step 5. Commit changes

1. Navigate to the lower left hand corner.
2. Click **Summary (Required)** and enter a comment title.
3. Click **Description** and enter a comment description. (Optional)
4. Click **Commit to main.**

## Step 6. Push changes

1. Navigate to the blue **Push commits to the origin remote** box.
2. Click **Push Origin**.
