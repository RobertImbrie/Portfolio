# Some notes from the author

Hi, my name is Robbie Imbrie! You're probably reading this because I've applied for a job at your company. Since most of the documentation I've worked on is internal, I've created writing samples instead.

Like most references, this document is pretty dry. My goal here was simple: describe the components of the GitHub UI and use consistent terminology.

Where necessary, like with **Topics** and **Collections**, I've added an additional line or two of explanation. Otherwise, I've emulated Divio's directive to make reference documents "austere and to the point."

# Reference Doc: Elements of the GitHub UI

## Header Menu

The header menu is located at the top of the page and contains the most commonly used actions and pages in GitHub. You can see a picture of it below.

The header elements are described as they appear on a desktop or laptop, from left to right. If you're using a mobile device or laptop, the menu may appear differently.

## Home

Appears as a cat with a tentacle growing out of it. Contains the GitHub home page.
