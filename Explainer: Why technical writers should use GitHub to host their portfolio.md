# Explainer: Why technical writers should use GitHub to host their portfolio
If you're a technical writer, there's any number of places you could host your portfolio. You could create your own website. You could use a dedicated portfolio hosting service like Behance or Dribbble. You could even share your samples directly through Google Docs or Office 365. Why use GitHub?

## 1. It shows you know what you're doing
[Nearly 90%](https://www.slintel.com/tech/source-code-management/github-market-share) of software companies use GitHub for source control management. Many companies use a docs-as-code approach, which means their documentation will also use Git. If you want to create and edit documentation for those companies, you need to demonstrate you to know the GitHub workflow.

## 2. It's accessible to the right people
Software engineers aren't the only ones that use GitHub. Employers and recruiters do too.

Suppose while you're looking for work, an employer notices your contributions to an open-source project's documentation on GitHub. When your portfolio is hosted directly on GitHub, the employer can easily find your writing samples and contact information, maximizing your chances of getting hired.

## 3. It's powerful
Unlike specialized portfolio sites, you have complete control over the end product.

With GitHub pages, you can use any static site template you want. If you're not happy with the way the template looks, you can easily modify it. Whatever site you create, you can make sure it's both attractive and distinctly yours.

## 4. It's free
Unlike most hosting options, GitHub is free. You don't have to worry about annual plans or unexpected price changes, and if you're not happy with GitHub, there's no cost to leaving.

## Conclusion
Anyone working in technology today should have a strong understanding of GitHub. But hosting your portfolio on GitHub offers more than that: it's practical, inexpensive, and powerful.
